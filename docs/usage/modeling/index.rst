Prerequisites
=============

- Python 3.9+
- SQLAlchemy 2.0+
- Basic understanding of SQLAlchemy models

Overview
========

Advanced Alchemy provides:

- Pre-configured base classes with common primary key strategies (UUID, BigInt, NanoID)
- Automatic audit fields (created_at, updated_at)
- Mixins for common patterns (slugs, unique constraints)
- Support for all SQLAlchemy 2.0 features

Quick Start
===========

The simplest model using BigIntAuditBase:

.. code-block:: python

    from advanced_alchemy.base import BigIntAuditBase
    from sqlalchemy.orm import Mapped, mapped_column

    class Post(BigIntAuditBase):
        __tablename__ = "posts"

        title: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(index=True)
        content: Mapped[str]

This model includes:

- Auto-incrementing BigInt primary key (``id``)
- Automatic ``created_at`` timestamp on creation
- Automatic ``updated_at`` timestamp on modifications
- Automatic table naming convention
