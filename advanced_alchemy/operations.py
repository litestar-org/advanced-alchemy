"""Advanced database operations for SQLAlchemy.

This module provides high-performance database operations that extend beyond basic CRUD
functionality. It implements specialized database operations optimized for bulk data
handling and schema management.

The operations module is designed to work seamlessly with SQLAlchemy Core and ORM,
providing efficient implementations for common database operations patterns.

Features

- Table merging and upsert operations
- Dynamic table creation from SELECT statements
- Bulk data import/export operations
- Optimized copy operations for PostgreSQL
- Transaction-safe batch operations

Todo:

- Add CTAS (Create Table As Select) functionality
- Implement bulk copy operations (COPY TO/FROM) for PostgreSQL
- Add support for temporary table operations
- Implement materialized view operations

Notes:

This module is designed to be database-agnostic where possible, with specialized
optimizations for specific database backends where appropriate.
